        JavaScript stores events as Event objects with their related data 
        and functionalities as properties and methods. When an event is 
        triggered, the event object can be passed as an argument to the 
        event handler function
    </p>
    <p>
        In the JS code, when the 'click' event is triggered on the 
        eventTarget, the eventHandlerFunction receives event, the Event 
        object, which has information related to the 'click' event. 
        Then, we log the time it took for the event to be triggered 
        since the document was loaded by accessing the .timeStamp 
        property of the event object.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are pre-determined properties associated with event objects.
        You can call these properties to see information about the event,
        for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the .target property to reference the element that the 
            event is registered to.
        </li>
        <li>the .type property to access the name of the event.</li>
        <li>the .timeStamp property to access the number of milliseconds 
            that passed since the document loaded and the event 
            was triggered.
        </li>
    </ul>
